## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cmdsnr/FormIntel.git
cd FormIntel
```
- Install Dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then:
```
python train_model.py
```
Which will generate the keras file in the /model directory.
Finally run: `python app.py`
and use the `generate_and_post.py` file to try with a data sample I made. (The file will also send a post request with the json file)
You can also post an image file: `curl -X POST -F "file=@somefile.png" http://127.0.0.1:5000/process`
